I'm a first year MIS student at Istanbul Bilgi University and a Student Expert at Postman who is trying to help and learn from folks in the community.

Nowadays, I'm working on Back-end development, creating open source projects and writing blog posts about the technologies I learn and use. You can read my blog posts on semihberkayozturk.github.io and find all of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/semihberkayozturk).
